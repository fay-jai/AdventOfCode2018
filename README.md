# 2018 Advent Of Code

This repository will contain a directory for each day's challenge. I'll be using `Elixir` as my programming language. Overall, the repository is set up using the `mix` tool, and the source code is located in the `lib` directory. I've tried to provide unit tests as much as possible.
